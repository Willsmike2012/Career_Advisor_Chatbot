There is no legacy codebase which means you dont need to suffer from old poorly-written code you need to write clean code from scratch. As one of the first engineers in the company you will be responsible for ensuring the code style is implemented consistently across the codebase right from the start. Keeping the code modular and easy to read is one of the top priorities. At the same time as a growing start-up we are moving at a fast pace so you need to be agile and focus on delivering software that does the job first and then improve it step by step. You will work directly with the founding team. Responsibilities Develop backend in Python Deliver efficient code that does the job first and iteratively improve it later Adhere to code guidelines and keep co-workers accountable for it as well Ship code that is easy to read maintain and debug Be on top of all most recent code practices libraries and frameworks and push the team to use better tools Conduct thoughtful code reviews for your team members Basic qualifications 3 years of Python experience 5 years of software engineering experience Proficiency in unitintegration testing Good understanding of how to implement useful logging Understanding of code complexity measurements and why it is important The skill of documenting your own code You iterate quickly with short feedback loops Youre comfortable with change and ambiguity and thrive working autonomously English level - Intermediate or higher Experienced using self-improvement apps\n",

There is no legacy codebase which means you dont need to suffer from old poorly-written code you need to write clean code from scratch. As one of the first engineers in the company you will be responsible for ensuring the code style is implemented consistently across the codebase right from the start. Keeping the code modular and easy to read is one of the top priorities. At the same time as a growing start-up we are moving at a fast pace so you need to be agile and focus on delivering software that does the job first and then improve it step by step. You will work directly with the founding team. Responsibilities Develop backend in Python Deliver efficient code that does the job first and iteratively improve it later Adhere to code guidelines and keep co-workers accountable for it as well Ship code that is easy to read maintain and debug Be on top of all most recent code practices libraries and frameworks and push the team to use better tools Conduct thoughtful code reviews for your team members Basic qualifications 3 years of Python experience 5 years of software engineering experience Proficiency in unitintegration testing Good understanding of how to implement useful logging Understanding of code complexity measurements and why it is important The skill of documenting your own code You iterate quickly with short feedback loops Youre comfortable with change and ambiguity and thrive working autonomously English level - Intermediate or higher Experienced using self-improvement apps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   role role engineer develop backend serve million user legacy codebase mean dont need suffer old poorlywritten code need write clean code scratch one first engineer company responsible ensuring code style implemented consistently across codebase right start keeping code modular easy read one top priority time growing startup moving fast pace need agile focus delivering software job first improve step step work directly founding team responsibility develop backend python deliver efficient code job first iteratively improve later adhere code guideline keep coworkers accountable well ship code easy read maintain debug top recent code practice library framework push team use better tool conduct thoughtful code review team member basic qualification year python experience year software engineering experience proficiency unitintegration testing good understanding implement useful logging understanding code complexity measurement important skill documenting code iterate quickly short feedback loop youre comfortable change ambiguity thrive working autonomously english level intermediate higher experienced using selfimprovement apps\n",
